2. **Real-Time Chat**: When a user clicks on a sports headline, a live chat room is created specifically for that topic. Users can chat in real-time using Firebase as the backend for message handling.
3. **User Identification**: On their first visit, users are assigned a unique ID stored in their browser's local storage. If they return to the app, they will continue using the same ID.
4. **Chat UI**: The chat UI is dynamic and updates instantly as new messages come in.
